- encoding ordering -> aim to order so that threads within the same warp gets same result from the multiplication (gray-code ordering)
- complete/incomplete warp separation -> complete warps are given to tensor cores, invalid ones are to cuda cores
- cache row ids on-chip
- row id compression
- spspmv
- pipelining
